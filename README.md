## Description

Calculate adjusted daily dive time based on dive start and end times
according to the collective agreement for biologists. Dive time may be
used to calculate dive pay; double-check dive times before submitting
them.

## Note

The BubbleTime package replaces the DiveTime script.

## Installation

Install the BubbleTime package from
[GitHub](https://github.com/grinnellm/BubbleTime) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github(repo = "grinnellm/BubbleTime")
```

## Example

This example shows how to calculate adjusted daily dive time from a
table of dive start and end times. This table is included in the package
data; use it as a template to ensure you set up your input file the same
way. First, load the BubbleTime package in the usual way.

``` r
library(BubbleTime)
```

    ## This is BubbleTime version 0.0.0.9000.

Then, calculate dive times.

``` r
# Calculate dive times
dive_times <- dive_buddy(
  file_path = system.file("extdata", "dives.csv", package = "BubbleTime")
)
```

``` r
# Print adjusted daily hours
dive_times$daily_hrs
```
