## Description

`r read.dcf(file = "DESCRIPTION", fields = "Description")`

## Note

The BubbleTime package supersedes the `DiveTime` script.
Do not use the `DiveTime` script.

## Installation

Install the BubbleTime package from
[GitHub](https://github.com/grinnellm/BubbleTime) with:

```{r install, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github(repo = "grinnellm/BubbleTime")
```

## Example

This example shows how to calculate adjusted daily dive time
from a table of dive start and end times.
This table is included in the package data;
use it as a template to ensure you set up your input file the same way.
First, load the BubbleTime package in the usual way.

```{r load}
library(BubbleTime)
```

Then, calculate dive times.

```{r dive_buddy}
# Calculate dive times
dive_times <- dive_buddy(
  file_path = system.file("extdata", "dives.csv", package = "BubbleTime")
)
# Print adjusted daily hours
dive_times$daily_hrs
```

## Additional information

Build the manual

```{r manual, eval = FALSE}
devtools::build_manual(pkg = ".", path = here("doc"))
```

and open the file ``r paste0("./doc/BubbleTime_", version, ".pdf")``.
In addition, there is a vignette with an example workflow;
build the vignette

```{r vignette, eval = FALSE}
devtools::build_vignettes(pkg = ".")
```

and open the file `./doc/Introduction.html`.
